This function and file are used to aggregate a time series signal, forecast these different granularities of aggregated data,
and then share the information between them by aggregating trhough least squares approaches.  The forecasting procedure used is Facebook's
prophet package.  The function returns a dictionary of dataframes that can be plotted or further analyzed.

Credit to Rob J. Hyndman and research partners as much of the code was developed with the help of their work

It was my intention to make some of the code look similar to certain sections in the Prophet and (Hyndman's) hts packages

        Parameters
        ----------------
             
        y - dataframe of time-series data
        
            	Layout:
                     1st Col - Time instances
                     2nd Col - Total of TS
             
        m - (int) frequency of time series eg. weekly is 52 (len(y) > 2*m)
            
        h - (int) the forecast horizon for the time series
        
        comb Â– (String)  the type of hierarchical forecasting method that the user wants to use. 
                        
        	Options:
                    "OLS" - optimal combination by ordinary least squares (Default), 
                    "WLSS" - optimal combination by structurally weighted least squares,
                    "WLSV" - optimal combination by variance weighted least squares
                    "BU" - bottom up combination
        
        aggList - (list) The factors that the user would like to consider for ex. m = 52, aggList = [1, 52] 
        
        include_history - (Boolean) input for the forecasting function of Prophet
                        
        cap - (Dataframe or Constant) carrying capacity of the input time series.  If it is a dataframe, then
         the number of columns must equal len(y.columns) - 1
        
        capF - (Dataframe or Constant) carrying capacity of the future time series.  If it is a dataframe, then
         the number of columns must equal len(y.columns) - 1
             
        changepoints - (DataFrame or List) changepoints for the model to consider fitting. If it is a dataframe, then
         the number of columns must equal len(y.columns) - 1
         
        n_changepoints - (constant or list) changepoints for the model to consider fitting. If it is a list, then
         the number of items must equal len(y.columns) - 1
          
        transform - (None or "BoxCox") Do you want to transform your data before fitting the prophet function? If yes, type "BoxCox"
        
        All other inputs - see Prophet
        
        Returns
        -----------------
         
        newDict - a dictionary of DataFrames with predictions, seasonalities and trends that can all be plotted
