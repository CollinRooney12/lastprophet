This is the file that contains all of the aggregation methods.  
Forecasts for all the different time instances are sent here to be revised and improved

Credit to Rob J. Hyndman and research partners as much of the code was developed with the help of their work

It was my intention to make some of the code look similar to certain sections in the Prophet and (Hyndman's) hts packages
